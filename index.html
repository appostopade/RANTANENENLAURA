Imagine that we visit all the countries in the world in 24 hours. Imagine the speed of the helicopter. Imagine MIIA taking beautiful pictures from the sky. Imagine what life would be like in the sky. Imagine that it is a dream and wake up then come back to the real world. Because it is impossible to go around the world in 24 hours. Ceci est juste un jeu d'imagination.</p>

          <p class="left-align light deep-purple-text text-lighten-3">
            I remember the first time we met, and I remember what I was dragging around physically and internally as difficulties. You were able to give me a smile, joy, strength through the French lessons we took and that you paid me for. I can never forget that period of my life. I didn't even know how to handle myself after that hard time right after my internship at Villa Karo. I was lucky to have you. It seems like I was the one who planned your trip. I was really sad after you left Grand-popo. It was as if I had lost something very expensive in my life. Fortunately, there is the mobile phone that exists today. And it has become easy to communicate with you.
            I felt since the first day we met that you are a very good person. I remember the walks, and the moments spent together. You are just extraordinary. When I have a lot of money, I will take care of the financial trips of your choice to any destination in the world to please you. I can't wait to see you again in Benin if it is still possible for you.
            I don't know if you know how important you are to me. I hope you know that you are a beautiful person and I am proud of you. You are an exceptional person and I wish you all the happiness in the world. Thank you for always remembering every thought, every word, every story that I told you. Thank you very much for your recent gift. It made me so happy. I had planned to make a gift and give it to Miia to give it to you but unfortunately the weather had surprised me and I didn't have it. But this time, I think you will receive my little gesture and appreciate it.
            And say a big thank you to MIIA too who was able to help me despite my level in English. She pays me for everything I do with her. And she is also very kind to me. You are both special. I love you very much.
            Thank you LAURA RANTANEN.</p>
